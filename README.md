## Only play the best part of a Spotify song

Have you ever listened to a good song on Spotify, and found a specific part of the song particularly worthy of repeat, but never got around to it, because you didn't bother manually skipping all the other parts? Could be an epic drum solo, a dope verse or anything that you like. Cause same! And now you never have to suffer that pain again. 

## How does it work

Obtain your Spotify token and simply type in when the best part starts, how long it lasts and press "loop". Now you can enjoy those legendary 47 seconds, until your ear falls off!
